/*
 1. function: a block of code that gives cerrtain behavior that returns a result or changes the status of an object.

 2. hoisting: JS takes the snapshot of all the javascripts,functions, variables present in the file/module, and hoists them on top of the file/module for JS runtime to reference from.

 3. closure: a paradigm when a function contains anthoer function and has some fields kept as private, and others as public by returning them via the child function.

 4. bind: the function present with each function that is used to change the context or hold it for the time function gets excuted.

 5. callback function: a function which is passed as a parameter in anoter function and will be executed to give desired results upon being called.

 6. datatype: types of data that can be stored and used in a programming language. In JS, we have 5 primitives (undefined, number, boolean, string, null) and a reference type (object).

 7. overloading: functions with the same name, but have differentsignatures, and number of arguments.

 8. apply/call: functions that are attached to functions(key-word function), they help the funtion in question to change th context to return the desired result.
